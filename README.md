# Task Project

This is a mobile app that allows users to come together and use the Pomodoro Technique to develop nourishing daily habits. Progress can be tracked through various methods, such as graphs and calendars. Adding people to your Pomodoro session can be a great motivator. A distinctive feature of this application is the timer with shared controls between users in a session.

## Features

- **Pie-chart** that shows a more detailed overview of the selected calendar day.
- **List** for your tasks, which can be modified.
- **Drop-down** of the tasks available for the Pomodoro session.
- **Time picker** for setting session time and break time.
- **Invitations** for adding people to your Pomodoro session.
- **Chat** for users who joined your session.
- **Page dedicated to statistics**.
