# Task Project

This is a mobile app that allows users to come together and use the Pomodoro Technique to develop nourishing daily habits. Progress can be tracked through various methods, such as graphs and calendars. Adding people to your Pomodoro session can be a great motivator. A distinctive feature of this application is the timer with shared controls between users in a session.

## Features

- **Scrollable calendar** that displays the colors of the tasks completed each day.
- **Pie-chart** that shows a more detailed overview of the selected calendar day.
- **List** for your tasks, which can be modified.
- **Drop-down** of the tasks available for the Pomodoro session.
- **Time picker** for setting session time and break time.
- **Invitations** for adding people to your Pomodoro session.
- **Chat** for users who joined your session.
- **Page dedicated to statistics**.

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

    For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:
